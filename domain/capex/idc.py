"""IDC (Interest During Construction) calculator.

IDC is interest on drawn senior debt during construction that gets
capitalized into CAPEX. This creates a circular dependency:
- Higher CAPEX → higher debt → more interest → even higher CAPEX

The circular is resolved via fixed-point iteration.

For Oborovo:
- IDC = 1,086.0 kEUR
- Construction: 12 months
- Gearing: 75.24%
- All-in rate: ~5.65%
