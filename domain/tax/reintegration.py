"""Fiscal reintegration - non-deductible items added back to taxable profit.

During construction period, certain costs are capitalized (not expensed).
When these costs are depreciated, they become deductible for tax purposes.
But during construction, they are NOT deductible and must be added back.

Items subject to fiscal reintegration for Oborovo:
- IDC (Interest During Construction) - capitalized, not expensed during construction
- Bank Fees - capitalized as part of CAPEX, not expensed during construction
- Commitment Fees - same as above

After COD, the depreciation of these items becomes deductible (no reintegration).
