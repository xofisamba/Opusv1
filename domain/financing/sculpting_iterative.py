"""Iterative Debt Sculpting - DSCR-Based Sizing with Binary Search.

This module implements true iterative debt sculpting matching Excel behavior:
- Binary search on debt amount until average DSCR ≈ target
- Per-period payment = EBITDA / DSCR_target (or capped)
- Lockup check per period (DSCR < 1.10 blocks distribution)
- Balance converges within tolerance

Excel uses Macro!DebtSculpting iterative approach — we replicate that here.
